question: |
  Debt collector letter
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Debt collector letter** Easy Form.

  This program creates a letter to a debt collector. You can choose to tell the debt collector:

  * To provide proof that you owe the debt,
  * That you disagree with the debt,
  * To stop contacting you, or only contact you in certain ways and times, and
  * Your income and belongings are currently **{exempt}** from being collected, which means that they are protected by law. This is also called "collection proof."
  
  The letter can include any or all of these things. You may still owe some or all of the debt. This letter can help you be sure of what you owe, and may help you negotiate a payment plan that you can afford.

  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**responding to debt collectors**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32906).

question: |
  Instructions
subquestion: |
  You must have been contacted by a debt collector to use this program. To make your letter you will need:

  * A debt collector's name and address,
  * Your account number used by the debt collector, and
  * Information about your income and property if you want us to help you figure out if you are currently collection proof. This includes public benefits or financial assistance, if you receive any.

  Set aside 10 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to continue later. 

  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some pages have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0dcaf0" ) } that helps explain things.

  After you download your letter, you must mail it to the debt collector.

question: |
  Debt information
subquestion: |
  There are many kinds of debt, and they are not all treated the same. Special rules apply to certain kinds of debt, including:

  * Overdue child support,
  * Overdue maintenance from a former marriage (also called "alimony"),
  * Court-ordered restitution to a crime victim,
  * Back taxes,
  * Non-tax debt owed to a federal agency, such as student loans or some federally-funded home loans, or
  * Fines, fees, and penalties owed to a state or local government (like traffic tickets or court costs).
  
  **Note:** You may have to pay these debts even if your income and property are **{exempt}** from being collected.
  
  If someone is trying to collect these debts, you might want to talk to a lawyer. Use [**Get Legal Help**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/get-legal-help) to find free or low-cost legal services in your area.

id: validate debt
question: |
  Do you want ${ debt_collector } to validate the debt?
subquestion: |
  Validating the debt means getting more information about the debt. This includes details about:

  * The name and address of the **{original creditor}**,
  * The amount and age of the debt, and
  * Why ${ debt_collector } thinks they have the authority to collect the debt.
  
  If you include this in your letter within 30 days of first hearing from the debt collector **in writing**, they have to **pause** collecting the debt until they send you this information.
fields:
  - no label: validate_debt
    datatype: yesnoradio
---
id: dispute debt
question: |
  Do you dispute the debt that ${ debt_collector } says you owe?
subquestion: |
  If you dispute the debt, it means you disagree with what ${ debt_collector } says you owe. You might dispute that you owe anything at all or the amount.
  
  Here are some examples of why you might dispute the debt:
  
  * "I am not responsible for the debt you're trying to collect."
  * "This debt is a result of identity theft."
  * "The amount that you are seeking to collect is incorrect."
  * "I already paid this debt."
  * "You have not provided enough proof that I owe this debt."
  * "This debt includes charges that I did not personally authorize."

  You can send a different letter to dispute how the debt appears on a credit report or background check. To learn how, read ILAO's article, [**Disputing inaccurate information on your credit report or background check**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32471).
  
  **Note:** When you send your letter, be sure to attach any paperwork that supports why you dispute what they say you owe.

fields:
  - no label: contact_prefs
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - I want ${ debt_collector } to stop all contact with me.: stop

id: unable to pay
question: |
  Are you able to pay the debt at this time?
subquestion: |
  You might have essential expenses like food, housing, medicine, and utilities that make it impossible to pay your debt right now.
  
  You may be able to pay the debt over time instead of sending a letter to stop contact. Learn about [**coming up with a payment plan**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/31416).

question: |
  Lawsuit information
subquestion: |
  If you receive a Complaint and Summons about a debt, you are being sued. To learn more about what to do when you are sued for debt collection, read ILAO's article about [**responding to a debt collection lawsuit**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/185946).
  
  It is important to respond to the lawsuit. In some cases you must file an **{Appearance}** and an **{Answer}**. To learn more about what to file, read ILAO's article about [**responding to a lawsuit**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32236). If you don't respond to the lawsuit, a default judgment will likely be entered against you. This would let the creditor try to garnish your wages or take money from your bank accounts.

question: |
  Have you been contacted by a debt collector?
subquestion: |
  The debt collector could be a debt buyer, a collection agency, or a law firm that is suing you for a debt. A debt collector is not the **{original creditor}**.

  ${ collapse_template(creditor_definition_help) }

  The debt collector could contact you by:
  
  * Phone, 
  * Letters or postcards,
  * Email, or
  * Text messages.

  **Learn more about debt collectors and creditors**
content: |  
  A **debt collector** is a person or company that regularly collects debts owed to another person or company. This is different than the original creditor.
  
  A **creditor** is the person or company that provided goods, services, or money. If someone does not pay the creditor what they owe, they can use a debt collector to try to get that money.

  Different laws apply to creditors and debt collectors. This program creates a letter that you can send to a debt collector, not an original creditor.

id: collection proof explainer
continue button field: collection_proof_explainer
question: |
  Income and property that are collection proof
subquestion: |
  If your income is from certain sources or below a certain level, debt collectors cannot legally seize your income. Also, the law protects the things you own up to a certain amount.
  
  Income from **{public benefits}** or these **{other sources}** are exempt.
  
  Income from employment, up to $675 per week, is also **{exempt}**.
  
  If you own your home, up to $15,000 in equity is protected. If you are married and own the home with your spouse, up to $30,000 is protected.

  Up to $2,400 of equity is protected for one car.
  
  You can protect up to $4,000 of any personal property you choose, except for real estate, with the "wildcard" exemption. This can be applied to cash, household goods, or to your car if you have more than $2,400 of equity in it.

  To learn more about collection proof income and property, read ILAO's article, [**Collecting from wages and bank accounts basics**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/31936).
---
id: collection proof check
question: |
  Do you want to check if you are collection proof?
subquestion: |
  Creditors can only take your money or property if your income or belongings are above a certain amount. If they aren't, you may be collection proof (also called "judgment proof"). This means creditors cannot garnish your wages or seize your assets, even if they sue you and the court decides you owe them money.

  Telling creditors that you are collection proof might make them slow down their demands for payment or offer a discounted settlement. To learn more, read ILAO's article, [**Negotiating with a debt collector or debt buyer**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/184721).

  ${ collapse_template(collection_proof_language_help) }

  **Note:** You are collection proof only as long as your financial condition stays the same or gets worse. If your financial condition improves, creditors who have a judgment against you may be able to collect money from you in the future, when you are no longer collection proof.
  
  If you already know whether you are collection proof, you can skip this step. Otherwise, we can help you determine if you qualify.
fields:
  - no label: collection_proof_check
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - Yes. I want to answer a few more questions to see if I am collection proof.: Yes
      - I already know that I am collection proof so I do not need to check. (Skip calculator and **include collection proof statement** in my letter.): already
      - I know that I have too much income or own too much property to be collection proof. I don't want to include this in my letter. (Skip calculator and **do not include collection proof statement** in my letter.): skip
---
template: collection_proof_language_help
subject: |
  **What collection proof statement will be added to the letter?**
content: |
    If you are collection proof, this is the statement that will appear in your letter.
      
    "Since all my income, property, and benefits are exempt under the laws of Illinois, any attempt to collect this debt will not be successful."

question: |
  Too much home equity
subquestion: |
  The law protects up to ${ currency(homestead_exemption) } of the value you own in your home. This is called the Homestead Exemption.

  Based on the information you provided, you own ${ currency(home_equity) } of your home's value, so you do not qualify for the full Homestead Exemption and are not collection proof.
  
  You may want to talk with a lawyer about protecting your home from collection. If you would like help finding free or low-cost legal services in your area, use [**Get Legal Help**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/get-legal-help).
  
  Your letter will not state that you are collection proof, but it can still tell the creditor if you dispute the debt, want to validate the debt, or want them to stop contacting you.

  **Explain more about loans and liens**
content: |  
  A **loan** is money that someone lets you borrow, with the promise that you'll pay it back later. Most of the time, you will also have to pay interest.
  
  A **lien** is a legal right that a person or company has to take something you own, such as a car or home, if you don’t pay back a debt. A lien does not give them the property right away, but it means they can take it if you don't pay back your debt within a specified timeframe.
